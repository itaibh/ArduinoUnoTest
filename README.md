Arduino Test

## Wiring

1. Arduino digital pin #13 has a built in resistor, so I use this to connect the power to the Breadboard to the left hand Plus line.
2. I connect the Arduino GND to the left hand Minus line.
3. I put the longer leg (anode) of the LED to to the left hand Plus line, somewhere below the current connection to the Arduino, and the shorter leg (cathode) to the Minus line next to it.
4. I place the button on each side of the breadboard middle gap (pins on `d-30`, `d-28`, `g-30` and `g-28`)
5. I connected `h-30` to digital pin #2.
6. I connected `c-28` to the left hand Minus line.
